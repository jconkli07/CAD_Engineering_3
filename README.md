## Skateboard

### Description
The assignment was to use Onshape to design a skateboard. It used a series of steps to create the different parts and then assemble them at the end. This assignment taught many of the basics of Onshape. It taught creating, dimensioning, and extruding sketches and importing and mating objects in assemblies. It also taught us about many of Onshape's built in tools including fillet, revolve, hole, offset, and replicate.

### 2.1 Deck Reflection
This taught me about sketches and basic extrusion. Constraints are used to define how objects in a sketch relate to each other. The hole tool is used to cut holes in existing objects. Make sure to set the merge scope to the object that you want to cut. <a href="https://www.onshape.com/en/resource-center/tech-tips/tech-tip-keyboard-shortcuts">List of onshape shortcuts</a>

### 2.2 Trucks Reflection
This assignment was more advanced and used a lot of interesting tools. The offset tool is used to create a copy of a geometry but make it a certain distance and direction away from the original geometry. It can also make it a different size. The use tools incoporates elements from outside of a sketch and allows them to be used in the sketch. I used the fillet tool to make some of the edges curved instead of hard corners.

### 2.3 Wheels and Bearings Reflection
This was a pretty quick assignment. I used the revolved tool to make the wheels into a 3d shape, it revolves a sketch around a line until it is a 3d shape. Dimension diameters by dragging the box below the 2 lines until it changes into a diameter (it will have the Ã˜). I used diameter dimensions to change the diameter and other measurements on the wheel.

### 2.4 Assembly Reflection
This assignment taught me a lot about using assemblies to assemble different parts. Inserting a part studio into an assembly inserts each part in the studio. Mate connectors create/define assembly relationships. There are many types of mates and they are used for different relationships. Going to insert>standard content allows you to insert nuts, bolts, and other basic parts. K shows/hides mates! The replicate tool makes a copy of an object and it's mates on a selected plane if it finds a matching place to put it. For example it finds all of the other nutles on the deck and puts nuts in them. I used this to copy the nuts and bolts very easily into the different hole. After this I feel very confident with using assemblies.

## One Brick to Rule Them All

### Description
The assignment was to take the 2x4 brick from 3.1 and configure it so that it can change color, shape, and type. I also had to configure the name of the part to reflect the color, shape, and size.

## Building Blocks

### Description
The assignment was to import different configuarations of the brick into an assembly and then assemble them to make a lego duck. This assignment teaches how to use the snap tool and how to import different configurations of a part. It also teaches you how to find the center of mass in an assembly.

### Reflection
This was a pretty simple assignment that built on our earlier knowledge of assemblies and added some new skills. The snap tool is used to create a mate that snaps two parts together. Drag one part over another part to create the mate. Within the snap mode the Q key rotates the part selected. Shortcut K toggles visiblity of mates. The center of mass is an object's balance point. It can be found by going to mass properties and then selecting the object. It will provide the x, y, and z coordinated from the origin to the center of mass. If you select a mate connector it can show the distance from that mate to the center of balance instead.
