## Skateboard

### Description
The assignment was to use Onshape to design a skateboard. It used a series of steps to create the different parts and then assemble dhtem at the end.

### 2.1 Reflection
This taught me about sketches and basic extrusion. Constraints are used to define how objects in a sketch relate to each other. The hole tool is used to cut holes in existing objects. Make sure to set the merge scope to the object that you want to cut. <a href="https://www.onshape.com/en/resource-center/tech-tips/tech-tip-keyboard-shortcuts">List of onshape shortcuts</a>

### 2.2 Reflection
This assignment was more advanced and used a lot of interesting tools. The offset tool is used to create a copy of a geometry but make it a certain distance and direction away from the original geometry. It can also make it a different size. The use tools incoporates elements from outside of a sketch and allows them to be used in the sketch. I used the fillet tool to make some of the edges curved instead of hard corners.

### 2.3 Reflection
This was a pretty quick assignment. I used the revolved tool to make the wheels into a 3d shape, it revolves a sketch around a line until it is a 3d shape. Dimension diameters by dragging the box below the 2 lines until it changes into a diameter (it will have the Ã˜). I used diameter dimensions to change the diameter and other measurements on the wheel.

### 2.4 Reflection
This assignment taught me a lot about using assemblies to assemble different parts. Inserting a part studio into an assembly inserts each part in the studio. Mate connectors create/define assembly relationships. There are many types of mates and they are used for different relationships. Going to insert>standard content allows you to insert nuts, bolts, and other basic parts. K shows/hides mates! The replicate tool makes a copy of an object and it's mates on a selected plane if it finds a matching place to put it. For example it finds all of the other nutles on the deck and puts nuts in them. I used this to copy the nuts and bolts very easily into the different hole. After this I feel very confident with using assemblies.
